## Comments

// A short comment about the assignment in general
The assignment was nice. It was not hard to implement but each request had a trick which made the requirement more complicated than it seemed at first glance.
// Was the Acceptance Criteria easy to understand?
Yes, it was. But there were some inconsistencies for me like the one that it's firstly said /files endpoint should save files in the task acceptance criteria although than it's mentioned the endpoint should save only one file per request below.
Besides, I was not exactly sure where I have to store files: in mongodb or locally.
